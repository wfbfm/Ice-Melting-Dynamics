# Ice-Melting-Dynamics
Python analysis code for the transient melting of ice.

The System (1b) and System (2b) folders contain Jupyter notebooks and data from 25 individual melting trajectories.  The Jupyter notebook obtain plots of the melting dynamics from the simulated data.

Simulations under System (1b) contained a hot thermostat at L/2; simulations under system (2b) contained a hot thermostat at L/4 and a cold thermostat at 3L/4.
